# 1 Foreword

The interface was established in cooperation between the Verband der Automobilindustrie e.V. (VDA) and Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau e. V. (VDMA).
The aim of both parties is to create a universally applicable interface.
Proposals for changes to the interface shall be submitted to the VDA, are evaluated jointly with the VDMA and adopted into a new version status in the event of a positive decision.
The contribution to this document via GitHub is greatly appreciated.
The repository can be found at the following link: https://github.com/vda5050/vda5050.


# 2 Objective of the document

The objective of the recommendation is to simplify the connection of new vehicles to an existing master control system and to enable parallel operation with AGVs from different manufacturers and conventional systems (inventory systems) in the same working environment.

A uniform interface between a master control and AGVs shall be defined.
This should be achieved by the following points:

- Description of a standard for communication between AGV and master control and thus a basis for the integration of transport systems into a continuous process automation using co-operating transport vehicles.
- Increase in flexibility through, among other things, increased vehicle autonomy, process modules and interface, and preferably the separation of a rigid sequence of event-controlled command chains.
- Reduction of implementation time due to high "Plug & Play" capability, as required information (e.g., order information) are provided by central services and are generally valid. Vehicles should be able to be put into operation independently of the manufacturer with the same implementation effort taking into account the requirements of occupational safety.
- Complexity reduction and increase of the "Plug & Play" capability of the systems through the use of uniform, overarching coordination with the corresponding logic for all transport vehicles, vehicle models and manufacturers.
- Increase in manufacturers' independence using common interfaces between vehicle control and coordination level.
- Integration of proprietary DTS inventory systems by implementing vertical communication between the proprietary master control and the superordinate master control (cf. Figure 1).

![Figure 1 Integration of DTS inventory systems](./assets/concept_DTS.png)
>Figure 1 Integration of DTS inventory systems

In order to implement the above-mentioned objectives, this document describes an interface for the communication of order and status information between AGV and master control.

Other interfaces required for operation between AGV and master control (e.g., taking special skills freely into account with regard to path planning, etc.) or for communicating with other system components (e.g., external peripherals, fire protection gates, etc.) are not initially included in this document.


# 3 Scope

This recommendation contains definitions and best practice regarding communication between automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and master control.
The goal is to allow AGVs with different characteristics (e.g., underrun tractor or fork lift AGV) to communicate with master control in a uniform language. 
This creates the basis for operating any combination of AGVs in a master control.
The master control provides orders and coordinates the AGV traffic.

The interface is based on the requirements from production and plant logistics in the automotive industry.
According to the formulated requirements, the requirements of intralogistics cover the requirements of the logistics department, i.e., the logistical processes from goods receiving to production supply to goods out, through control of freely navigating vehicles and guided vehicles.

In contrast to automated vehicles, autonomous vehicles solve problems that occur on the basis of the corresponding sensor system and algorithms independently and can react accordingly to changes in a dynamic environment or be adapted to them shortly afterwards.
Autonomous properties such as the independent bypassing of obstacles can be fulfilled by freely navigating vehicles as well as guided vehicles.
However, as soon as the path planning is carried out on the vehicle itself, this document describes freely navigating vehicles (see glossary).
Autonomous systems are not completely decentralized (swarm intelligence) and have defined behavior through predefined rules.

For the purpose of a sustainable solution, an interface is described below which can be expanded in its structure.
This should enable a complete coverage of the master control for vehicles that are guided.
Vehicles that are freely navigating can be integrated into the structure; a detailed specification required for this is not part of this recommendation.

For the integration of proprietary stock systems, individual definitions of the interface may be required, which are not considered as part of this recommendation.

# 4 Requirements and protocol definition

The communication interface is designed to support the following requirements:

- Control of min. 1000 vehicles
- Enabling the integration of vehicles with different degrees of autonomy
- Enable decision, e.g., with regard to the selection of routes or the behavior at intersections

Vehicles should transfer their status at a regular interval or when their status changes.

Communication is done over wireless networks, taking into account the effects of connection failures and loss of messages.

The message protocol is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), which is to be used in conjunction with a JSON structure.
MQTT 3.1.1 was tested during the development of this protocol and is the minimum required version for compatibility.
MQTT allows the distribution of messages to subchannels, which are called "topics".
Participants in the MQTT network subscribe to these topics and receive information that concerns or interests them.

The JSON structure allows for a future extension of the protocol with additional parameters.
The parameters are described in English to ensure that the protocol is readable, comprehensible and applicable outside the German-speaking area.


# 5 Process and content of communication

There are at least the following participants for the operation of AGVs:

- The operator of the AGV system provides basic information
- The master control organizes and manages the operation
- The AGV carries out the orders

Figure 2 describes the communication content during the operational phase.
During implementation or modification, the AGV and master control are manually configured.

![Figure 2 Structure of the Information Flow](./assets/information_flow_VDA5050.png)
>Figure 2 Structure of the Information Flow

During the implementation phase, the driverless transport systems (DTS) consisting of master control and AGVs is set up.
The necessary framework conditions are defined by the operator and the required information is either entered manually by them or stored in the master control by importing from other systems.
Essentially, this concerns the following content:

- Definition of routes: Using CAD import, routes can be imported to the master control.
Alternatively, routes can also be implemented manually in the master control by the operator.
Routes can be one-way streets, restricted for certain vehicle groups (based on the size ratios), etc.
- Route network configuration:
Within the routes, stations for loading and unloading, battery charging stations, peripheral environments (gates, elevators, barriers), waiting positions, buffer stations, etc. are defined.
- Vehicle configuration: The physical properties of an AGV (size, available load carrier mounts, etc.) are stored by the operator.
The AGV shall communicate this information via the topic `factsheet` in a specific way that is defined in Section [6.15 Topic "Factsheet"](#615-topic-factsheet) of this document.

The configuration of routes and the route network described above are not part of this document.
They form the basis for enabling order control and driving course assignment by the master control based on this information and the transport requirements to be completed.
The resulting orders for an AGV are then transferred to the vehicle via an MQTT message broker.
This then continuously reports its status to the master control in parallel with the execution of the job.
This is also done using the MQTT message broker.

Functions of the master control are:

- Assignment of orders to the AGVs
- Route calculation and guidance of the AGVs (taking into account the limitations of the individual physical properties of each AGV, e.g., size, maneuverability, etc.)
- Detection and resolution of blockages ("deadlocks")
- Energy management: Charging orders can interrupt transfer orders
- Traffic control: Buffer routes and waiting positions
- (Temporary) changes in the environment, such as freeing certain areas or changing the maximum speed
- Communication with peripheral systems such as doors, gates, elevators, etc.
- Detection and resolution of communication errors

Functions of the AGVs are:

- Localization
- Navigation along associated routes (guided or autonomous)
- Execution of actions
- Continuous transmission of vehicle status

In addition, the integrator shall take into account the following when configuring the overall system (incomplete list):

- Map configuration: The coordinate systems of the master control and the AGV shall be matched.
- Pivot point: The use of different points of the AGV or points of charge as a pivot point leads to different envelopes of the vehicle. The reference point may vary depending on the situation, e.g., it may be different for an AGV carrying a load and for an AGV that does not carry a load.


# 6 Protocol specification

The following section describes the details of the communication protocol.
The protocol specifies the communication between the master control and the AGV.
Communication between the AGV and peripheral equipment, e.g., between the AGV and a gate, is excluded.

The different messages are presented in tables describing the contents of the fields of the JSON that is sent as an order, state, etc.

In addition, JSON schemas are available for validation in the public git repository (https://github.com/VDA5050/VDA5050).
The JSON schemas are updated with every release of the VDA5050. If there are differences between the JSON schemas and this document, the variant in this document applies.


## 6.1 Symbols of the tables and meaning of formatting

The table contains the name of the identifier, its unit, its data type, and a description, if any.

Identification | Description
---|---
standard | Variable is an elementary data type
**bold** | Variable is a non-elementary data type (e.g., JSON object or array) and defined separately
*italic* | Variable is optional
***italic and bold***| Variable is optional and a non-elementary data type
arrayName[arrayDataType] | Variable (here arrayName) is an array of the data type included in the square brackets (here the data type is arrayDataType)

All keywords are case sensitive.
All field names are in camelCase.
All enumerations are in UPPERCASE without underscores.


### 6.1.1 Optional fields

If a variable is marked as optional, it means that it is optional for the sender because the variable might not be applicable in certain cases (e.g., when the master control sends an order to an AGV, some AGVs plan their trajectory themselves and the field `trajectory` within the `edge` object of the order can be omitted).

If the AGV receives a message that contains a field which is marked as optional in this protocol, the AGV is expected to act accordingly and cannot ignore the field.
If the AGV cannot process the message accordingly then the expected behavior is to communicate this within an error message and to reject the order.

Master control shall only send optional information that the AGV supports.

Example: Trajectories are optional.
If an AGV cannot process trajectories, master control shall not send a trajectory to the vehicle.

The AGV shall communicate which optional parameters it needs via an AGV `factsheet` message.


### 6.1.2 Permitted characters and field lengths

All communication is encoded in UTF-8 to enable international adaption of descriptions.
The recommendation is that IDs should only use the following characters:

A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - . :

A maximum message length is not defined, but limited by the MQTT protocol specification and perhaps by technical constraints defined inside the factsheet.
If an AGVs memory is insufficient to process an incoming order, it is to reject the order.
The matching of maximum field lengths, string lengths or value ranges is up to the integrator.
For ease of integration, AGV vendors shall supply an AGV factsheet that is detailed in [Factsheet Section](#616-topic-factsheet).


### 6.1.3 Notation of fields, topics and enumerations

Topics and fields in this document are highlighted in the following style: `exampleField` and `exampleTopic`.
Enumerations shall be written in uppercase. These values are enclosed in single quotation marks in the document.
This includes keywords such as in the `actionStatus` field ('WAITING', 'FINISHED', etc.).


### 6.1.4 JSON data types

Where possible, JSON data types shall be used.
A Boolean value is thus encoded by "true" or "false", not with an enumeration ('TRUE', 'FALSE') or magic numbers.
Numerical data types are specified with type and precision, e.g., float64 or uint32. Special number values from the IEEE 754 like NaN and infinity are not supported.


## 6.2 MQTT connection handling, security and QoS

The MQTT protocol provides the option of setting a last will message for a client.
If the client disconnects unexpectedly for any reason, the last will is distributed by the broker to other subscribed clients.
The use of this feature is described in Section [6.14 Topic "connection"](#614-topic-connection).

If the AGV disconnects from the broker, it keeps all the order information and fulfills the order up to the last released node.

Protocol security needs to be taken into account by broker configuration.

To reduce the communication overhead, the MQTT QoS level 0 (Best Effort) is to be used for the topics `order`, `instantActions`, `state`, `factsheet` and `visualization`.
The topic `connection` shall use the QoS level 1 (At Least Once).


## 6.3 MQTT topic levels

The MQTT topic structure is not strictly defined due to the mandatory topic structure of cloud providers.
For a cloud-based MQTT broker the topic structure has to be adapted individually to match the topics defined in this protocol.
This means that the topic names defined in the following sections are mandatory.

For a local broker the MQTT topic levels are suggested as followed:

**interfaceName/majorVersion/manufacturer/serialNumber/topic**

Example:
```
uagv/v2/KIT/0001/order
```

MQTT Topic Level | Data type | Description
---|---|---
interfaceName | string | Name of the used interface
majorVersion | string | Major version number of the VDA 5050 recommendation, preceded by "v"
manufacturer | string | Manufacturer of the AGV.
serialNumber | string | Unique AGV serial number consisting of the following characters: <br>A-Z <br>a-z <br>0-9 <br>_ <br>. <br>: <br>-
topic | string | Topic (e.g., order or state) see Section [6.5 Topics for Communication](#65-topics-for-communication)

Note: Since the `/` character is used to define topic hierarchies, it shall not be used in any of the aforementioned fields.
The `$` character is also used in some MQTT brokers for special internal topics, so it should not be used either.


## 6.4 Protocol header

Each JSON message starts with a header.
In the following sections, the following fields will be referenced as header for readability.
The header consists of the following individual elements.
The header is not a JSON object.

Object structure/Identifier | Data type | Description
---|---|---
headerId | uint32 | Header ID of the message.<br> The headerId is defined per topic and incremented by 1 with each sent (but not necessarily received) message.
timestamp | string | Timestamp (ISO 8601, UTC); YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.ffZ (e.g., "2017-04-15T11:40:03.12Z").
version | string | Version of the protocol [Major].[Minor].[Patch] (e.g., 1.3.2).
manufacturer | string | Manufacturer of the AGV.
serialNumber | string | Serial number of the AGV.


### Protocol version

The protocol version uses semantic versioning as versioning schema.

Examples for major version changes:

- Breaking changes, e.g., new non-optional fields

Examples for minor version changes:

- New features like an additional topic for visualization

Examples for patch version:

- Higher available precision for a batteryCharge


## 6.5 Topics for communication

The AGV protocol uses the following topics for information exchange between master control and AGV.

Topic name | Published by | Subscribed by | Used for | Implementation | Schema
---|---|---|---|---|---
order | master control | AGV | Communication of driving orders from master control to the AGV | mandatory | order.schema
instantActions | master control | AGV | Communication of the actions that are to be executed immediately | mandatory | instantActions.schema
state | AGV | master control | Communication of the AGV state | mandatory | state.schema
visualization | AGV | Visualization systems | Higher frequency of position topic for visualization purposes only | optional | visualization.schema
connection | Broker/AGV | master control | Indicates when AGV connection is lost, not to be used by master control for checking the vehicle health, added for an MQTT protocol level check of connection | mandatory | connection.schema 
factsheet | AGV | master control | Parameters or vendor-specific information to assist set-up of the AGV in master control | mandatory | factsheet.schema


## 6.6 Topic: "order" (from master control to AGV)

The topic "order" is the MQTT topic via which the AGV receives a JSON encapsulated order.


### 6.6.1 Concept and logic

The basic structure of an order is a graph of nodes and edges.
The AGV is expected to traverse the nodes and edges to fulfill the order.
The full graph of all connected nodes and edges is held by master control.

The graph representation in the master control contains restrictions, e.g., which AGV is allowed to traverse which edge.
These restrictions will not be communicated to the AGV.
The master control only includes edges in an AGV order which the concerning AGV is allowed to traverse.

![Figure 3 Graph representation in master control and graph transmitted in orders](./assets/graph_representation_transmission.png)
>Figure 3 Graph representation in master control and graph transmitted in orders

The nodes and edges are passed as two lists in the order message.
The order of the nodes and edges within those lists also governs in which sequence the nodes and edges shall be traversed.

For a valid order, there shall be at least one node and the number of edges shall be equal to the number of nodes minus one.

The first node of an order shall be trivially reachable for the AGV.
This means either that the AGV is already standing on the node, or that the AGV is in the node's deviation range.

Nodes and edges both have a boolean attribute `released`.
If a node or edge is released, the AGV is expected to traverse it.
If a node or edge is not released, the AGV shall not traverse it.

An edge can be released only if both the start and the end node of the edge are released.

After an unreleased edge, no released nodes or edges can follow in the sequence.

The set of released nodes and edges are called the "base".
The set of unreleased nodes and edges are called the "horizon".

It is valid to send an order without a horizon.

An order message does not necessarily describe the full transport order.
For traffic control and to accommodate resource constrained vehicles, the full transport order (which might consist of many nodes and edges) can be split up into many sub-orders, which are connected via their `orderId` and `orderUpdateId`.
The process of updating an order is described in the next section.


### 6.6.2 Orders and order update

To support traffic management, master control can split the path communicated via order into two parts:

- *"Base"*: This is the defined route that the AGV is allowed to travel. All nodes and edges of the base route have already been released by the master control for the vehicle. The last node of the base is called decision point.
- *"Horizon"*: This is the route currently planned by master control for the AGV to travel after the decision point. The horizon route has not yet been released by the master control.

The AGV shall stop at the decision point if no further nodes and edges are added to the base. In order to ensure a fluent movement, the master control should extend the base before the AGV reaches the decision point, if the traffic situation allows for it.

Since MQTT is an asynchronous protocol and transmission via wireless networks is not reliable, the base cannot be changed. The master control shall therefore assume that the base has already been executed by the AGV. A later section describes a procedure to cancel an order, but this is also considered unreliable due to the communication limitations mentioned above.

The master control has the possibility to change the horizon by sending an updated route to the AGV which includes the changed list of nodes and edges. The procedure for changing the horizon route is shown in Figure 4.

![Figure 4 Procedure for changing the driving route "Horizon"](./assets/driving_route_horizon.png)
>Figure 4 Procedure for changing the driving route "Horizon"

In Figure 4, an initial job is first sent by the control panel at time t = 1.
Figure 5 shows the pseudocode of a possible job.
For the sake of readability, a complete JSON example has been omitted here.

```
{
	orderId: "1234"
	orderUpdateId:0,
	nodes: [
	 	 f {released: True},
	 	 d {released: True},
	 	 g {released: True},
	 	 b {released: False},
	 	 h {released: False}
	],
	edges: [
		e1 {released: True},
		e3 {released: True},
		e8 {released: False},
		e9 {released: False}
	]
}
```
>Figure 5 Pseudocode of an order.

At time t = 3, the order is updated by sending an extension of the order (see example in Figure 6).
Note that the `orderUpdateId` is incremented and that the first node of the order update corresponds to the last shared base node of the previous order message.

This ensures that the AGV can also perform the order update, i.e., that the first node of the job update is reachable by executing the edges already known to the AGV.

```
{
	orderId: 1234,
	orderUpdateId: 1,
	nodes: [
		g {released: True},
		b {released: True},
		h {released: True},
		i {released: False}
	],
	edges: [
		e8 {released: True},
		e9 {released: True},
		e10 {released: False}
	]
}
```
>Figure 6 Pseudocode of an order update. Note the change of the `orderUpdateId`.

This also aids in the event that an order update is lost (e.g., due to an unreliable wireless network).
The AGV can always check that the last known base node has the same `nodeId` (and `nodeSequenceId`, more on that later) as the first new base node.

Also note that node g is the only base node that is sent again.
Since the base cannot be changed, a retransmission of nodes f and d is not valid.

It is important, that the contents of the stitching node (node g in the example case) are not changed.
For actions, deviation range, etc., the AGV shall use the instructions provided in the first order (Figure 5, orderUpdateId 0).

![Figure 7 Regular update process - order extension](./assets/update_order_extension.png)
>Figure 7 Regular update process - order extension.

Figure 7 describes how an order should be extended.
It shows the information that is currently available on the AGV.
The `orderId` stays the same and the `orderUpdateId` is incremented.

The last node of the previous base is the first base node in the updated order.
With this node the AGV can add the updated order onto the current order (stitching).
The other nodes and edges from the previous base are not resent.

Master control has the option to make changes to the horizon by sending entirely different nodes as the new base.
The horizon can also be deleted.

To allow loops in orders (like going from node a to b and then back to a) a `sequenceId` is assigned to the node and edge objects.
This `sequenceId` runs over the nodes and edges (first node of an order receives a 0, the first edge then gets the 1, the second node then gets the 2, and so on).
This allows for easier tracking of the order progress.

Once a `sequenceId` is assigned, it does not change with order updates (see Figure 7).
This is necessary to determine on AGV side to which node the master control refers to.

Figure 8 describes the process of accepting an order or order update.

![Figure 8 The process of accepting an order or orderUpdate](./assets/process_order_update.png)
>Figure 8 The process of accepting an order or order update.

1)	**is received order valid?**:
All formatting and JSON data types are correct?

2)	**is received order new or an update of the current order?**:
Is `orderId` of the received order different to `orderId` of order the vehicle currently holds?

3)	**is vehicle still executing an order or waiting for an update?**:
Are `nodeStates` not empty or are `actionStates` containing states which are neither 'FAILED' nor 'FINISHED'? Nodes and edges and the corresponding action states of the order horizon are also included inside the state. Vehicle might still have a horizon and therefore waiting for an update and executing an order.

4) **is start of new order close enough to current position?**:	Is the vehicle already standing on the node, or is it in the node's deviation range (see Section [6.6.1 Concept and logic](#661-concept-and-logic))?

5) **is received order update deprecated?**: Is `orderUpdateId` smaller than the one currently on the vehicle?

6)	**is received order update currently on vehicle?**: Is `orderUpdateId` equal to the one currently on the vehicle?

7)	**is the received update a valid continuation of the currently still running order?**:	Is the first node of the received order equal to the current decision point (last node of the current base)? The vehicle is still moving or executing actions related to the base released in previous order updates or still has a horizon and is therefore waiting for a continuation of the order. In this case, the order update is only accepted if the first node of the new base is equal to the last node of the previous base.

8)	**is the received update a valid continuation of the previously completed order?**: Are `nodeId` and `sequenceId` of the first node of the received order update equal to `lastNodeId` and `lastNodeSequenceId`? The vehicle is not executing any actions anymore neither is it waiting for a continuation of the order (meaning that it has completed its base with all related actions and does not have a horizon). The order update is now accepted if it continues from the last traversed node, therefore the first node of the new base needs to match the vehicle's `lastNodeId` as well as `lastNodeSequenceId`.

9)	populate/append states refers to the `actionStates`/`nodeStates`/`edgeStates`.


### 6.6.3 Order cancellation (by master control)

In the event of an unplanned change in the base nodes, the order shall be canceled by using the instantAction `cancelOrder`.

After receiving the instantAction `cancelOrder`, the vehicle stops (based on its capabilities, e.g., right where it is or on the next node).

If there are actions scheduled, these actions shall be cancelled and report 'FAILED' in their `actionState`.
If there are running actions, those actions should be cancelled and also be reported as 'FAILED'.
If the action cannot be interrupted, the `actionState` of that action should reflect that by reporting 'RUNNING' while it is running, and after that the respective state ('FINISHED', if successful and 'FAILED', if not).
While actions are running, the cancelOrder action shall report 'RUNNING', until all actions are cancelled/finished.
After all movement of the vehicle and all of its actions are stopped, the `cancelOrder` action status shall report 'FINISHED'.

The `orderId` and `orderUpdateId` are kept.

Figure 9 shows the expected behavior for different AGV capabilities.

![Figure 9 Expected behavior after a cancelOrder](./assets/process_cancel_order.png)
>Figure 9 Expected behavior after a `cancelOrder`.


#### 6.6.3.1 Receiving a new order after cancellation

After the cancellation of an order, the vehicle shall be in a state to receive a new order.

In the case of an AGV that localizes itself on nodes via a tag, the new order has to begin on the node the AGV is now standing on (see also Figure 5).

In case of an AGV that can stop in between nodes, the choice is up to master control how the next order should be started.
The AGV shall accept both methods.

There are two options:

- Send an order, where the first node is a temporary node that is positioned where the AGV currently stands. The AGV shall then realize that this node is trivially reachable and accept the order.
- Send an order, where the first node is the last traversed node of the previous order but set the deviation range so large that the AGV is within this range. Thus, the AGV shall realize that this node shall be counted as traversed and accept the order.


#### 6.6.3.2 Receiving a cancelOrder action when AGV has no order

If the AGV receives a `cancelOrder` action but, the AGV currently has no order, or the previous order was canceled, the `cancelOrder` action shall be reported as 'FAILED'.

The AGV shall report a "noOrderToCancel" error with the `errorLevel` set to 'WARNING'.
The `actionId` of the `instantAction` shall be passed as an `errorReference`.


### 6.6.4 Order rejection

There are several scenarios, when an order shall be rejected.
These scenarios are shown in Figure 8 and described below.


#### 6.6.4.1 Vehicle gets a malformed new order

Resolution:

1. Vehicle does NOT take over the new order in its internal buffer.
2. The vehicle reports the warning "validationError"
3. The warning shall be reported until the vehicle has accepted a new order.


#### 6.6.4.2 Vehicle receives an order with actions it cannot perform or with fields that it cannot use

Examples:

- Non-executable actions: lifting height higher than maximum lifting height, lifting actions although no stroke is installed, etc.
- Non-useable fields: trajectory, etc.

Resolution:

1. Vehicle does NOT take over the new order in its internal buffer
2. Vehicle reports the warning "orderError" with the wrong fields as error references
3. The warning shall be reported until the vehicle has accepted a new order.


#### 6.6.4.3 Vehicle gets a new order with the same orderId, but a lower orderUpdateId than the current orderUpdateId

Resolution:

1. Vehicle does NOT take over the new order in its internal buffer.
2. Vehicle keeps the previous order in its buffer.
3. The vehicle reports the warning "orderUpdateError"
4. The vehicle continues with executing the previous order.

If the AGV receives an order with the same `orderId` and `orderUpdateId` twice, the second order will be ignored. 
This might happen, if the master control resends the order because the state message was received too late by master control and it could therefore not verify that the first order had been received.

### 6.6.5 Corridors

The optional `corridor` edge attribute allows the vehicle to deviate from the edge trajectory for obstacle avoidance and defines the boundaries within which the vehicle is allowed to operate.
To use the `corridor` attribute, a predefined trajectory is required that the vehicle would follow if no `corridor` attribute was defined. This can be either the trajectory defined on the vehicle known to the master control or the trajectory sent in an order. The behavior of a vehicle using the `corridor` attribute is still the behavior of a line-guided vehicle, except that it's allowed to temporarily deviate from a trajectory to avoid obstacles.

*Remark:
An edge inside an order defines a logical connection between two nodes and not necessarily the (real) trajectory that a vehicle follows when driving from the start node to the end node.
Depending on the vehicle type, the trajectory that a vehicle takes between the start and end nodes is either defined by master control via the trajectory edge attribute or assigned to the vehicle as a predefined trajectory.
Depending on the internal state of the vehicle, the selected trajectory may vary.*

![Figure 10 Edges with corridor attribute.](./assets/edges_with_corridors.png)
>Figure 10 Edges with a `corridor` attribute that defines the left and right boundaries within which a vehicle is allowed to deviate from its predefined trajectory to avoid obstacles. On the left, the kinematic center defines the allowed deviation, while on the right, the contour of the vehicle, possibly extended by the load, defines the allowed deviation. This is defined by the `corridorRefPoint` parameter.

The area in which the vehicle is allowed to navigate independently (and deviate from the original edge trajectory) is defined by a left and a right boundary.
The optional `corridorRefPoint` field specifies whether the vehicle control point or the vehicle contour should be inside the defined boundary.
The boundaries of the edges shall be defined in such a way that the vehicle is inside the boundaries of the new and now current edge as soon as it passes a node.
Instead of setting the corridor boundaries to zero, master control shall not use the `corridor` attribute if the vehicle shall not deviate from the trajectory.

The vehicle's motion control software shall constantly check that the vehicle is within the defined boundaries.
If not, the vehicle shall stop because it is out of the allowed navigation space and report an error.
The master control can decide if user interaction is required or if the vehicle can continue by canceling the current order and sending a new order to the vehicle with corridor information that allows the vehicle to move again.

*Remark: Allowing the vehicle to deviate from the trajectory increases the possible footprint of the vehicle during driving. This circumstance shall be considered during initial operation, and if the master control makes a traffic control decision based on the vehicle's footprint.*

### 6.7 Maps

To ensure consistent navigation among different types of AGVs, the position is always specified in reference to the project-specific coordinate system (see Figure 11).
For the differentiation between different levels of a site or location, a unique `mapId` is used.
The map coordinate system is to be specified as a right-handed coordinate system with the z-axis pointing skywards.
A positive rotation therefore is to be understood as a counterclockwise rotation.
The vehicle coordinate system is also specified as a right-handed coordinate system with the x-axis pointing in the forward direction of the vehicle and the z-axis pointing upward. The vehicle reference point is defined as (0,0,0) in the vehicle reference frame, unless specified otherwise.
This is in accordance with Section 2.11 in DIN ISO 8855.

![Figure 11 Coordinate system with sample AGV and orientation](./assets/coordinate_system_vehicle_orientation.png)
>Figure 11 Coordinate system with sample AGV and orientation

The X, Y, and Z coordinates shall be given in meters. 
The orientation shall be in radians and shall be within +Pi and ‚ÄìPi.

![Figure 12 Coordinate systems for map and vehicle](./assets/coordinate_system_vehicle_map.png)
>Figure 12 Coordinate systems for map and vehicle


### 6.7.1 Map distribution

To enable an automatic map distribution and intelligent management of restarting the vehicles if necessary, a standardized way to distribute maps is introduced.

The map files to be distributed are stored on a dedicated map server that is accessible by the vehicles. To ensure efficient transmission, each transmission should consist of a single file. If multiple maps or files are required, they should be bundled or packed into a single file. The process of transferring a map from the map server to a vehicle is a pull operation, initiated by the master control triggering a download command using an `instantAction`.

Each map is uniquely identified by a combination of a map identifier (field `mapId`) and a map version (field `mapVersion`). The map identifier describes a specific area of the vehicle's physical workspace, and the map version indicates updates to previous versions. Before accepting a new order, the vehicle shall check that there is a map on the vehicle for each map identifier in the requested order. It is the responsibility of the master control to ensure that the correct maps are activated to operate the vehicle.

In order to minimize downtime and make it easier for the master control to synchronize the activation of new maps, it is essential that maps are pre-loaded or buffered on the vehicles. The status of the maps on the vehicle can be accessed via the vehicle state channel. It's important to note that transferring a map to an AGV and then activating the map are different processes. To activate a pre-loaded map on a vehicle, the master control sends an instant action. In this case, any other map with the same map identifier but a different map version is automatically disabled. Maps can be deleted by the master control with another instant action. The result of this process is shown in the vehicle state.

The map distribution process is shown in Figure 13.

![Figure 13 Map distribution process](./assets/map_distribution_process.png)
>Figure 13 Communication required between master control, AGV and map server to download, enable, and delete a map.

#### 6.7.2 Maps in the vehicle state

The `mapId` field in the `agvPosition` of the state represents the currently active map. Information about the maps available on a vehicle is presented in the `maps` array, which is a component of the state message. Each entry in this array is a JSON object consisting of the mandatory fields `mapId`, `mapVersion`, and `mapStatus`, which can be either 'ENABLED' or 'DISABLED'. An 'ENABLED' map can be used by the vehicle if necessary. A 'DISABLED' map shall not be used. The status of the download process is indicated by the current action not being completed. Errors are also reported in the state.

Note that multiple maps with different `mapId` can be enabled at the same time. There can only be one version of maps with the same `mapId` enabled at a time. If the `maps` array is empty, this means that there are currently no maps available on the vehicle.


#### 6.7.3 Map download

The map download is triggered by the `downloadMap` instant action from the master control. This command contains the mandatory parameters `mapId` and `mapDownloadLink` under which the map is stored on the map server and which can be accessed by the vehicle.

The AGV sets the `actionStatus` to 'RUNNING' as soon as it starts downloading the map file. If the download is successful, the `actionStatus` is updated to 'FINISHED'. If the download is unsuccessful, the status is set to 'FAILED'. Once the download has been successfully completed, the map shall be added to the array of `maps` in the state. Maps shall not be reported in the state, before they are ready to be enabled.

It is important to ensure that the process of downloading a map does not modify, delete, enable, or disable any existing maps on the vehicle.
The vehicle shall reject the download of a map with a `mapId` and `mapVersion` that is already on the vehicle. An error shall be reported, and the status of the instant action shall be set to 'FAILED'. The master control shall first delete the map on the vehicle and then restart the download.


#### 6.7.4 Enable downloaded maps

There are two ways to enable a map on a vehicle:

1. **Master control enables map**: Use the `enableMap` instant action to set a map to 'ENABLED' on the vehicle. Other Versions of the same `mapId` with different `mapVersion` are set to 'DISABLED'.
2. **Manually enable a map on the vehicle**: In some cases, it might be necessary to enable the maps on the vehicle directly. The result shall be reported in the vehicle state.

It is the responsibility of the master control to ensure that the correct maps are activated on the vehicle when sending the corresponding `mapId` as part of a `nodePosition` in an order.
If the vehicle is to be set to a specific position on a new map, the `initPosition` instant action is used.


#### 6.7.5 Delete maps on vehicle
The master control can request the deletion of a specific map from a vehicle. This is done with the instant action `deleteMap`. When a vehicle runs out of memory, it should report this to the master control, which can then initiate the deletion of maps. The vehicle itself is not allowed to delete maps.
After successfully deleting a map, it is important to remove that map's entry from the vehicle's array of maps in the vehicle state.


## 6.8 Actions

If the AGV supports actions other than driving, these actions are executed via the action field that is attached to either a node or an edge, or sent via the separate topic `instantActions` (see Section [6.10 Topic "instantActions"](#610-topic-instantactions-from-master-control-to-agv)).

Actions that are to be executed on an edge shall only run while the AGV is on the edge (see Section [6.11.2 Traversal of nodes and entering/leaving edges](#6112-traversal-of-nodes-and-enteringleaving-edges-triggering-of-actions)).

Actions that are triggered on nodes can run as long as they need to run and should be self-terminating (e.g., an audio signal that lasts for five seconds or a pick action, that is finished after picking up a load) or formulated pairwise (e.g., "activateWarningLights" and "deactivateWarningLights"), although there may be exceptions.

The following section presents predefined actions that shall be used by the AGV, if the AGV's capabilities map to the action description.
If there is a sensible way to use the defined parameters, they shall be used.
Additional parameters can be defined, if they are needed to execute an action successfully.

If there is no way to map some action to one of the actions of the following section, the AGV manufacturer can define additional actions that shall be used by master control.

## 6.9 Topic: "instantActions" (from master control to AGV)

In certain cases, it is necessary to send actions to the AGV that need to be performed immediately.
This is made possible by publishing an `instantAction` message to the topic `instantActions`.
These shall not conflict with the content of the AGV's current order (e.g., `instantAction` to lower fork, while order says to raise fork).

Some examples for which instant actions could be relevant are:
- pause the AGV without changing anything in the current order;
- resume order after pause;
- activate signal (optical, audio, etc.).

For additional information, see Section [7 Best practice](#7-best-practice).

Object structure | Data type | Description
---|---|---
headerId | uint32 | Header ID of the message.<br> The header ID is defined per topic and incremented by 1 with each sent (but not necessarily received) message.
timestamp | string | Timestamp (ISO 8601, UTC); YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.ffZ (e.g., "2017-04-15T11:40:03.12Z")
version | string | Version of the protocol [Major].[Minor].[Patch] (e.g., 1.3.2).
manufacturer | string | Manufacturer of the AGV.
serialNumber | string | Serial number of the AGV.
actions [action] | array | Array of actions that need to be performed immediately and are not part of the regular order.

When an AGV receives an `instantAction`, an appropriate `actionStatus` is added to the `actionStates` array of the AGV's state.
The `actionStatus` is updated according to the progress of the action.
See also Figure 16 for the different transitions of an `actionStatus`.


## 6.10 Topic: "state" (from AGV to master control)

The AGV state will be transmitted on only one topic.
Compared to separate messages (e.g., for orders, battery state and errors) using one topic will reduce the workload of the broker and the master control for handling messages, while also keeping the information about the AGV state synchronized.

The AGV state message will be published with occurrence of relevant events or at the latest every 30s via MQTT broker to master control.

Events that trigger the transmission of the state message are:
- Receiving an order
- Receiving an order update
- Changes in the load status
- Errors or warnings
- Driving over a node
- Switching the operating mode
- Change in the `driving` field
- Change in the `nodeStates`, `edgeStates` or `actionStates`
- Change in the `maps` field

There should be an effort to curb the amount of communication.
If two events correlate with each other (e.g., the receiving of a new order usually forces an update of the `nodeStates` and `edgeStates`; as does the driving over a node), it is sensible to trigger one state update instead of multiple.


### 6.10.1 Concept and logic

The order progress is tracked by the `nodeStates` and `edgeStates`.
Additionally, if the AGV is able to derive its current position, it can publish its position via the `position` field.

If the AGV plans the path by itself, it shall communicate its calculated trajectory (including base and horizon) in the form of NURBS via the `trajectory` object in the state message, unless master control cannot use this field, and it was agreed during integration, that this field shall not be sent.
After nodes are released by master control, the AGV is not allowed to change its trajectory.

The `nodeStates` and `edgeStates` includes all nodes/edges, that the AGV still shall traverse.

![Figure 14 Order information provided by the state topic. Only the ID of the last node and the remaining nodes and edges are transmitted](./assets/order_information_state_topic.png)
>Figure 14 Order information provided by the state topic. Only the ID of the last node and the remaining nodes and edges are transmitted



### 6.10.2 Traversal of nodes and entering/leaving edges, triggering of actions

The AGV decides on its own, when a node should count as traversed.
Generally, the AGV's control point should be within the node's `allowedDeviationXY` and its orientation within `allowedDeviationTheta`.
If the edge attribute `corridor` of the subsequent edge is set, these boundaries should be met additionally.

The AGV reports the traversal of a node by removing its `nodeState` from the `nodeStates` array and setting the `lastNodeId`, `lastNodeSequenceId` to the traversed node's values.

As soon as the AGV reports the node as traversed, the AGV shall trigger the actions associated with the node, if any.

The traversal of a node also marks the leaving of the edge leading up to the node.
The edge shall then be removed from the `edgeStates` and the actions that were active on the edge shall be finished.

The traversal of the node also marks the moment, when the AGV enters the following edge, if there is one.
The edge's actions shall now be triggered.
An exception to this rule is, if the AGV has to pause on the edge (because of a soft or hard blocking edge, or otherwise) ‚Äì then the AGV enters the edge after it begins moving again.

![Figure 15 Depiction of nodeStates, edgeStates, and actionStates during order handling](./assets/states_during_order_handling.png)
>Figure 15 Depiction of `nodeStates`, `edgeStates`, and `actionStates` during order handling


### 6.10.3 Base request

If the AGV detects that its base is running low, it can set the `newBaseRequest` flag to "true" to prevent unnecessary braking.


### 6.10.4 Information

The AGV can submit arbitrary additional information to master control via the `information` array.
It is up to the AGV how long it reports information via an information message.

Master control shall not use the info messages for logic, it shall only be used for visualization and debugging purposes.


### 6.10.5 Errors

The AGV reports errors via the `errors` array.
Errors have two levels: 'WARNING' and 'FATAL'.
A 'WARNING' is a self-resolving error, e.g., a field violation.
A 'FATAL' error needs human intervention.
Errors can pass references that help with finding the cause of the error via the `errorReferences` array.

#### Operating Mode Description
The following description lists the operatingMode of the topic "state".

Identifier | Description
---|---
AUTOMATIC | AGV is under full control of the master control. <br>AGV drives and executes actions based on orders from the master control.
SEMIAUTOMATIC | AGV is under control of the master control.<br> AGV drives and executes actions based on orders from the master control. <br>The driving speed is controlled by the HMI (speed can't exceed the speed of automatic mode).<br>The steering is under automatic control (non-safe HMI possible).
MANUAL | Master control is not in control of the AGV. <br>Supervisor doesn't send driving order or actions to the AGV. <br>HMI can be used to control the steering and velocity and handling device of the AGV. <br>Location of the AGV is sent to the master control. <br>When the AGV enters or leaves this mode, it immediately clears all the orders (safe HMI required).
SERVICE | Master control is not in control of the AGV. <br>Master control doesn't send driving order or actions to the AGV. <br>Authorized personnel can reconfigure the AGV.
TEACHIN | Master control is not in control of the AGV. <br>Supervisor doesn't send driving order or actions to the AGV. <br>The AGV is being taught, e.g., mapping is done by a master control.

>Table 1 The operating modes and their meaning


## 6.11 Action states

When an AGV receives an `action` (either attached to a `node` or `edge` or via an `instantAction`), it shall represent this `action` with an `actionState` in its `actionStates` array.

`actionStates` describe in the field `actionStatus` at which stage of the action's life cycle the action is.

Table 2 describes, which value the enum `actionStatus` can hold.

actionStatus | Description
---|---
'WAITING' | Action was received by the AGV but the node where it triggers was not yet reached or the edge where it is active was not yet entered.
'INITIALIZING' | Action was triggered, preparatory measures are initiated.
'RUNNING' | The action is running.
'PAUSED' | The action is paused because of a pause instantAction or external trigger (pause button on the AGV)
'FINISHED' | The action is finished. <br>A result is reported via the resultDescription.
'FAILED' | Action could not be finished for whatever reason.

>Table 2 The acceptable values for the actionStatus field

A state transition diagram is provided in Figure 16.

![Figure 16 All possible status transitions for actionStates](./assets/action_state_transition.png)
>Figure 16 All possible status transitions for actionStates


## 6.12 Action blocking types and sequence

The order of multiple actions in a list define the sequence, in which those actions are to be executed.
The parallel execution of actions is governed by their respective `blockingType`.

Actions can have three distinct blocking types, described in Table 3.

blockingType | Description
---|---
NONE | Action can be executed in parallel with other actions and while the vehicle is driving.
SOFT | Action can be executed in parallel with other actions. Vehicle shall not drive.
HARD | Action shall not be executed in parallel with other actions. Vehicle shall not drive.

>Table 3 Action blocking types

If there are multiple actions on the same node with different blocking types, Figure 17 describes how the AGV should handle these actions.

![Figure 17 Handling multiple actions](./assets/handling_multiple_actions.png)
>Figure 17 Handling multiple actions


## 6.13 Topic "visualization"

For a near real-time position update the AGV can broadcast its position and velocity on the topic `visualization`.

The structure of the position object is the same as the position and velocity object in the state.
For additional information see Section [6.10.6 Implementation of the state message](#6106-implementation-of-the-state-message) for the vehicle state.
The update rate for this topic is defined by the integrator.


## 6.14 Topic "connection"

During the connection of an AGV client to the broker, a last will topic and message can be set, which is published by the broker upon disconnection of the AGV client from the broker.
Thus, the master control can detect a disconnection event by subscribing the connection topics of all AGVs.
The disconnection is detected via a heartbeat that is exchanged between the broker and the client.
The interval is configurable in most brokers and should be set around 15 seconds.
The Quality of Service level for the `connection` topic shall be 1 - At Least Once.

The suggested last will topic structure is:

**uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection**

The last will message is defined as a JSON encapsulated message with the following fields:

Identifier | Data type | Description
---|---|---
headerId | uint32 | Header ID of the message. <br>The headerId is defined per topic and incremented by 1 with each sent (but not necessarily received) message.
timestamp | string | Timestamp (ISO8601, UTC); YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.ffZ(e.g., "2017-04-15T11:40:03.12Z").
version | string | Version of the protocol [Major].[Minor].[Patch] (e.g., 1.3.2).
manufacturer | string | Manufacturer of the AGV.
serialNumber | string | Serial number of the AGV.
connectionState | string | Enum {'ONLINE', 'OFFLINE', 'CONNECTIONBROKEN'}<br><br>'ONLINE': connection between AGV and broker is active.<br><br>'OFFLINE': connection between AGV and broker has gone offline in a coordinated way. <br><br> 'CONNECTIONBROKEN': the connection between AGV and broker has unexpectedly ended.

The last will message will not be sent, when a connection is ended in a graceful way by using an MQTT disconnection command.
The last will message is only sent by the broker, if the connection is unexpectedly interrupted.

**Note**: Due to the nature of the last will feature in MQTT, the last will message is defined during the connection phase between the AGV and the MQTT broker.
As a result, the timestamp and headerId fields will always be outdated.

AGV wants to disconnect gracefully:

1. AGV sends "uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection" with `connectionState` set to `OFFLINE`.
2. Disconnect the MQTT connection with a disconnect command.

AGV comes online:

1. Set the last will to "uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection" with the field `connectionState` set to `CONNECTIONBROKEN`, when the MQTT connection is created.
2. Send the topic "uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection" with `connectionState` set to `ONLINE`.

All messages on this topic shall be sent with a retained flag.

When connection between the AGV and the broker stops unexpectedly, the broker will send the last will topic: "uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection" with the field `connectionState` set to `CONNECTIONBROKEN`.


## 6.15 Topic "factsheet"

The factsheet provides basic information about a specific AGV type series.
This information allows comparison of different AGV types and can be applied for the planning, dimensioning, and simulation of an AGV system.
The factsheet also includes information about AGV communication interfaces which are required for the integration of an AGV type series into a VDA-5050-compliant master control.

The values for some fields in the AGV factsheet can only be specified during system integration, for example the assignment of project-specific load and station types, together with the list of station and load types which are supported by this AGV.

The factsheet is intended as both a human-readable document and for machine processing, e.g., an import by the master control application, and thus is specified as a JSON document.

The master control can request the factsheet from the AGV by sending the instant action `factsheetRequest`.

All messages on this topic shall be sent with a retained flag.

# 7 Best practice

This section includes additional information, which helps in facilitating a common understanding concurrent with the logic of the protocol.

## 7.1 Error reference

If an error occurs due to an erroneous order, the AGV should return a meaningful error reference in the field errorReferences (see Section [6.10.6 Implementation of the state message](#6106-implementation-of-the-state-message) of the state topic).
This can include the following information:

- `headerId`
- Topic (`order` or `instantAction`)
- `orderId` and `orderUpdateId` if error was caused by an order update
- `actionId` if error was caused by an action
- List of parameters if error was caused by erroneous action parameters

If an action cannot be completed because of external factors (e.g., no load at expected position), the actionId should be referenced.


## 7.2 Format of parameters

Parameters for errors, information and actions are designed as an array of JSON objects with key-value pairs.

| **Field** | **data type** | **description** |
|---|---|---|
**actionParameter** { | JSON object | actionParameter for the indicated action, e.g., deviceId, loadId, external triggers.
key | string | The key of the parameter.
value</br>} | One of:</br>array,</br>boolean,</br>number,</br>string,</br>object | The value of the parameter that belongs to the key.

Examples for the `actionParameter` of an action "someAction" with key-value pairs for stationType and loadType:

"actionParameters":[
{"key":"stationType", "value": "floor"},
{"key":"weight", "value": 8.5},
{"key": "loadType", "value": "pallet_eu"}
]

The reason for using the proposed scheme of "key": "actualKey", "value": "actualValue" is to keep the implementation generic. The "actualValue" can be of any possible JSON data type, such as float, bool, and even an object.
