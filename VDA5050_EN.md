# 1 Foreword 


The interface was established in cooperation between the Verband der Automobilindustrie e. V. (German abbreviation VDA) and Verband Deutscher Maschinen-und Anlagenbau e. V. (German abbreviation VDMA). 
The aim of both parties is to create an universally applicable interface. 
Proposals for changes to the interface shall be submitted to the VDA, are evaluated jointly with the VDMA and adopted into a new version status in the event of a positive decision.
The contribution to this document via GitHub is greatly appreciated.
The Repository can be found at the following link: http://github.com/vda5050/vda5050.



# 2 Objective of the document 

The objective of the recommendation is to simplify the connection of new vehicles to an existing master control and thus to integrate into an existing automated guided vehicles (AGV) system when used in the automotive industry and to enable parallel operation with AGV from different manufacturers and conventional systems (inventory systems) in the same working environment.

Uniform interface between master control and AGV shall be defined. 
In detail, this should be achieved by the following points: 

- Description of a standard for communication between AGV and master control and thus a basis for the integration of transport systems into a continuous process automation using co-operating transport vehicles.
- Increase in flexibility through, among other things, increased vehicle autonomy, process modules and interface, and preferably the separation of a rigid sequence of event-controlled command chains. 
- Reduction of implementation time due to high "Plug & Play" capability, as required information (e.g. order information) are provided by central services and are generally valid. Vehicles should be able to be put into operation independently of the manufacturer with the same implementation effort taking into account the requirements of occupational safety.
- Complexity reduction and increase of the "Plug & Play" capability of the systems through the use of uniform, overarching coordination with the corresponding logic for all transport vehicles, vehicle models and manufacturers.
- Increase in manufacturers independence using common interfaces between vehicle control and coordination level.
- Integration of proprietary DTS inventory systems by implementing vertical communication between the proprietary master control and the superordinate master control (cf.  Figure 1).

![Figure 1 Integration of DTS inventory systems](./assets/Figure1.png)
>Figure 1 Integration of DTS inventory systems

In order to implement the above-mentioned objectives, this document describes an interface for the communication of order and status information between AGV and master control.

Other interfaces required for operation between AGV and master control (e.g., for exchanging map information, taking special skills freely into account with regard to path planning, etc.) or for communicating with other system components (e.g., external peripherals, fire protection gates, etc.) are not initially included in this document. 



# 3 Scope

This recommendation contains definitions and best practice regarding communication between automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and master control.
The goal is to allow AGV with different characteristics (e.g., underrun tractor or fork lift AGV) to communicate with master control in uniform language. 
This creates the basis for operating any combination of AGV in a master control.
The master control provides orders and coordinates the AGV traffic.

The interface is based on the requirements from production and plant logistics in the automotive industry.
According to the formulated requirements, the requirements of intralogistics cover the requirements of the logistics department, i.e., the logistical processes from goods receiving to production supply to goods out, through control free navigating vehicles and guided vehicles.

In contrast to automated vehicles, autonomous vehicles solve problems that occur on the basis of the corresponding sensor system and algorithms independently and can react accordingly to changes in a dynamic environment or be adapted to them shortly afterwards. 
Autonomous properties such as the independent bypassing of obstacles can be fulfilled by free navigating vehicles as well as guided vehicles. 
However, as soon as the path planning is carried out on the vehicle itself, this document describes free navigating vehicles (see glossary).
Autonomous systems are not completely decentralized (swarm intelligence) and have defined behavior through predefined rules.

For the purpose of a sustainable solution, an interface is described below which can be expanded in its structure.
This should enable a complete coverage of the master control for vehicles that are guided. 
Vehicles that are free navigating can be integrated into the structure; a detailed specification required for this is not part of this recommendation.

For the integration of proprietary stock systems, individual definitions of the interface may be required, which are not considered as part of this recommendation.



## 3.1 Other applicable documents

Document | Description 
---|---
VDI Guideline 2510 | Driverless transport systems (DTS)
VDI Guideline 4451 Sheet 7 | Compatibility of driverless transport systems (DTS) - DTS master control 
DIN EN ISO 3691-4 | Industrial Trucks Safety Requirements and Verification-Part 4: Driverless trucks and their systems 



# 4 Requirements and protocol definition 

The communication interface is designed to support the following requirements: 

- Control of min. 1000 vehicles
- Enabling the integration of vehicles with different degrees of autonomy
- Enable decision, e.g., with regard to the selection of routes or the behavior at intersections 

Vehicles should transfer their status at a regular interval or when their status changes. 

Communication is done over wireless networks, taking into account the effects of connection failures and loss of messages. 

The message log is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), which is to be used in conjunction with a JSON structure.
MQTT 3.1.1 was tested during the development of this protocol and is the minimum required version for compatibility.
MQTT allows the distribution of messages to subchannels, which are called "topics". 
Participants in the MQTT network subscribe to these topics and receive information that concerns or interests them.

The JSON structure allows for a future extension of the protocol with additional parameters.
The parameters are described in English to ensure that the protocol is readable, comprehensible and applicable outside the German-speaking area.



# 5 Process and content of communication

As shown in the information flow to the operation of AGV, there are at least the following participants (see Figure 2): 

- the operator provides basic information
- the master control organizes and manages the operation 
- the AGV carries out the orders

Figure 2 describes the communication content during the operational phase.
During implementation or modification, the AGV and master control are manually configured. 

![Figure 2 Structure of the Information Flow](./assets/Figure2.png)
>Figure 2 Structure of the Information Flow

During the implementation phase, the driverless transport systems (DTS) consisting of master control and AGV is set up.
The necessary framework conditions are defined by the operator and the required information is either entered manually by him or stored in the master control by importing from other systems. 
Essentially, this concerns the following content:

- Definition of  routes: Using CAD import,  routes can be taken over in the master control.
Alternatively, routes can also be implemented manually in the master control by the operator.
Routes can be one-way streets,  restricted for certain vehicle groups (based on the size ratios), etc.
- Route network configuration:
Within the routes, stations for loading and unloading, battery charging stations, peripheral environments (gates, elevators, barriers), waiting positions, buffer stations, etc. are defined. 
- Vehicle configuration: The physical properties of an AGV (size, available load carrier mounts, etc.) are stored by the operator.
The AGV must communicate this information via the subtopic `factsheet` in a specific way that is defined in the [AGV Factsheet section](#factsheet) of this document.

The configuration of routes and the route network described above is not part of this document.
It forms the basis for enabling order control and driving course assignment by the master control based on this information and the transport requirements to be completed. 
The resulting orders for an AGV are then transferred to the vehicle via an MQTT message broker.
This then continuously reports its status to the master control in parallel with the execution of the job. 
This is also done using the MQTT message broker.

Functions of the master control are: 

- Assignment of orders to the AGV
- Route calculation and guidance of the AGV (taking into account the limitations of the individual physical properties of each AGV, e.g., size, maneuverability, etc.)
- Detection and resolution of blockages ("deadlocks")
- Energy management: Charging orders can interrupt transfer orders
- Traffic control: Buffer routes and waiting positions
- (temporary) changes in the environment, such as freeing certain areas or changing the maximum speed
- Communication with peripheral systems such as doors, gates, elevators, etc. 
- Detection and resolution of communication errors 

Functions of the AGV are: 

- Localization
- Navigation along associated routes (guided or autonomous) 
- Continuous transmission of vehicle status 

In addition, the integrator must take into account the following when configuring the overall system (incomplete list): 

- Map configuration: The coordinate systems of the master control and the AGV must be matched.
- Pivot point: The use of different points of the AGV or points of charge as a pivot point leads to different envelopes of the vehicle. The reference point may vary depending on the situation, e.g., it may be different for an AGV carrying a load and for an AGV that does not carry a load.



# 6 Protocol specification 

The following section describes the details of the communication protocol.
The protocol specifies the communication between the master control and the AGV.
Communication between the AGV and peripheral equipment, e.g., between the AGV and a gate, is excluded.

The different messages are presented in tables describing the contents of the fields of the JSON that is sent as an order, state, etc.

In addition, JSON schemas are available for validation in the public Git repository (https://github.com/VDA5050/VDA5050/json_schemas).
The JSON schemas are updated with every release of the VDA5050.



## 6.1 Symbols of the tables and meaning of formatting

The table contains the name of the identifier, its unit, its data type, and a description, if any.

Identification | Description [ENG]
---|----
standard | Variable is an elementary data type 
**bold** | Variable is a non-elementary data type (e.g., JSON-object or array) and defined separately
*italic* | Variable is optional 
[Square brackets] | Variable (here arrayName) is an array of the data type included in the square brackets (here the data type is squareBrackets)

All keywords are case sensitive.
All field names are in camelCase. 
All enumerations are in UPPERCASE.



### 6.1.1 Optional fields

If a variable is marked as optional, it means that it is optional for the sender because the variable might not be applicable in certain cases (e.g., when the master control sends an order to an AGV, some AGV plan their trajectory themselves and the field trajectory within the edge object of the order can be omitted). 

If the AGV receives a message that contains a field which is marked as optional in this protocol, the AGV is expected to act accordingly and cannot ignore the field. 
If the AGV cannot process the message accordingly then the expected behavior is to communicate this within an error message and to reject the order.

Master control shall only send optional information that the AGV supports.

Example: Trajectories are optional. 
If an AGV cannot process trajectories, master control shall not send a trajectory to the vehicle.

The AGV must communicate which optional parameters it needs via an AGV factsheet message.


### 6.1.2 Permitted characters and field lengths

All communication is encoded in UTF-8 to enable international adaption of descriptions.
The recommendation is that IDs should only use the following characters:

A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - . :

A maximum message length is not defined. 
If an AGV memory is insufficient to process an incoming order, it is to reject the order.
The matching of maximum field lengths, string lengths or value ranges is up to the integrator.
For ease of integration, AGV vendors must supply an AGV factsheet that is detailed in [section 7 - AGV Factsheet](#factsheet).



### 6.1.3 Notation of enumerations 

Enumerations must be written in uppercase. 
This includes keywords such as the states of the actions (WAITING, FINISHED, etc...) or values of the "direction" field (LEFT, RIGHT, 443MHZ, etc...).



### 6.1.4 JSON Datatypes 

Where possible, JSON data types must be used.
A Boolean value is thus encoded by "true / false", NOT with an enumeration (TRUE, FALSE) or magic numbers.
Numerical data types are specified with type and precision, e.g. float64 or uint32. Special number values from the IEEE 754 like NaN and infinity are not supported.



## 6.2 MQTT connection handling, security and QoS

The MQTT protocol provides the option of setting a last will message for a client.
If the client disconnects unexpectedly for any reason, the last will is distributed by the broker to other subscribed clients.
The use of this feature is described in section 6.14.

If the AGV disconnects from the broker, it keeps all the order information and fulfills the order up to the last released node. 

Protocol-Security needs to be taken in account by broker configuration.

To reduce the communication overhead, the MQTT QoS level 0 (Best Effort) is to be used for the topics `order`, `state`, `factsheet` and `visualization`.
The topic `connection` shall use the QoS level 1 (At Least Once).



## 6.3 MQTT-Topic Levels 

The MQTT-Topic structure is not strictly defined due to the mandatory topic structure of cloud providers.
For a cloud-based MQTT-Broker the topic structure has to be adapted individually to match the topics defined in this protocol. 
This means that the topic names defined in the following sections are mandatory.

For a local broker the MQTT topic levels are suggested as followed:

**interfaceName/majorVersion/manufacturer/serialNumber/topic**

Example: 
```
uagv/v2/KIT/0001/order
```


MQTT Topic Level | Data type | Description 
---|---|---
interfaceName | string | Name of the used interface 
majorVersion | string | Major version number, preceded by "v"
manufacturer | string | Manufacturer of the AGV (e.g., RobotCompany)
serialNumber | string | Unique AGV Serial Number consisting of the following characters: <br>A-Z <br>a-z <br>0-9 <br>_ <br>. <br>: <br>-
topic | string | Topic (e.g. Order or System State) see Cap. 6.5

Note: Since the `/` character is used to define topic hierarchies, it must not be used in any of the aforementioned fields.
The `$` character is also used in some MQTT brokers for special internal topics, so it should not be used either.

## 6.4 Protocol Header

Each JSON starts with a header.
In the following sections, the following fields will be referenced as header for readability. 
The header consists of the following individual elements. 
The header is not a JSON object.

Object structure/Identifier | Data type | Description 
---|---|---
headerId | uint32 | header ID of the message.<br> The headerId is defined per topic and incremented by 1 with each sent (but not necessarily received) message. 
timestamp | string | Timestamp (ISO 8601, UTC); YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.ffZ (e.g.“2017-04-15T11:40:03.12Z”)
version | string | Version of the protocol [Major].[Minor].[Patch] (e.g. 1.3.2)
manufacturer | string | Manufacturer of the AGV 
serialNumber | string | Serial number of the AGV 

### Protocol version

The protocol version uses semantic versioning as versioning schema.

Examples for major version changes: 

- Breaking changes, e.g., new non-optional fields

Examples for minor version changes: 

- New features like an additional topic for visualization 

Examples for patch version: 

- Higher available precision for a batteryCharge 



## 6.5 Subtopics for communication

The AGV protocol uses the following topics for information exchange between master control and AGV

Subtopic name | Published by | Subscribed by | Used for | Implementation | Schema 
---|---|---|---|---|---
order | master control | AGV | Communication of driving orders from master control to the AGV | mandatory | order.schema 
instantActions | master control | AGV | Communication of the actions that are to be executed immediately | mandatory | instantActions.schema
state | AGV | master control | Communication of the AGV state | mandatory | state.schema
visualization | AGV | Visualization systems | Higher frequency of position topic for visualization purposes only | optional | visualization.schema
connection | Broker/AGV | master control | Indicates when AGV connection is lost, not to be used by master control for checking the vehicle health, added for an MQTT protocol level check of connection | mandatory | connection.schema 
factsheet | AGV | master control | Setup of AGV in master control | mandatory | factsheet.schema


## 6.6 Topic: "order"(from master control to AGV)

The topic "order" is the MQTT topic via which the AGV receives a JSON encapsulated order. 



### 6.6.1 Concept and Logic 

The basic structure of an order is a graph of nodes and edges.
The AGV is expected to traverse the nodes and edges to fulfill the order.
The full graph of all connected nodes and edges is held by master control.

The graph representation in the master control contains restrictions, e.g., which AGV is allowed to traverse which edge.
These restrictions will not be communicated to the AGV.
The master control only includes edges in an AGV order which the concerning AGV is allowed to traverse.

It is to be avoided that the master control has a separate graph representation for each type of AGV.
Whenever possible, one location, e.g., a waiting position in front of fire door, should only have one node for all types of AGV.
However, due to the different sizes and specifications of AGV, it might be necessary to deviate from this standard in certain situations.

![Figure 3 Graph representation in Master Control and graph transmitted in orders](./assets/Figure3.png) 
>Figure 3 Graph representation in Master Control and graph transmitted in orders

The nodes and edges are passed as two lists in the order message.
The lists order also governs in which sequence the nodes and edges must be traversed.

For a valid order, at least one node must be present. 
The number of acceptable edges is the number of nodes minus one, not more or less.

The first node of an order must be trivially reachable for the AGV. 
This means either that the AGV is already standing on the node, or that the AGV is in the nodes deviation range.

Nodes and edges both have a boolean attribute “released”.
If a node or edge is released, the AGV is expected to traverse it. 
If a node or edge is not released, the AGV must not traverse it.

An edge only can be released, if both the start and end node of the edge are released.

After an unreleased edge, no released nodes or edges can follow in the sequence. 

The set of released nodes and edges are called the “base”. 
The set of unreleased nodes and edges are called the “horizon”.

It is valid to send an order without a horizon.

An order message does not necessarily describe the full transport order. 
For traffic control and to accommodate resource constrained vehicles, the full transport order (which might consist of many nodes and edges) can be split up into many sub-orders, which are connected via their orderId and orderUpdateId. 
The process of updating an order is described in the next section.



### 6.6.2 Orders and order update 

For traffic control the order-topic includes only the path to a decision point. 
Before reaching the decision point, the master control will send an updated path with additional path segments.
To communicate to the AGV what it will most likely have to do after reaching the decision point, an order consists of two separate parts: 

- <u>Drive to the decision point "Base":</u> The "Base" is the defined route that the AGV travels. All nodes and edges of the "Base" route have already been approved by the control panel for the vehicle. 
- <u>Estimated journey from the decision point "Horizon":</u> The "Horizon" is the route that the AGV is likely to drive, if there is no traffic jam. The "Horizon" route has not yet been approved by the control panel. However, the AGV will initially only travel to the last junction of the "Base" route.

Since MQTT is an asynchronous protocol and transmission via wireless networks is not reliable, it is important to note, that the "base" cannot be changed. 
The master control can therefore assume that the "base" is executed by the AGV.
A later section describes a procedure for cancelling an order, but this is also considered unreliable due to the communication restrictions mentioned above.

The master control has the possibility to change the driving commands of the "Horizon" route. 
Before the AGV arrives at the decision point via the "base" route, the master control will send an updated route to the AGV, which includes the other nodes. 
The procedure for changing the Horizon route is shown in Figure 4.

![Figure 4 Procedure for changing the driving route "Horizon"](./assets/Figure4.png)
>Figure 4 Procedure for changing the driving route "Horizon"

In Figure 4, an initial job is first sent by the control panel at time t = 1.
Figure 5 shows the pseudo code of a possible job.
For the sake of readability, a complete JSON example has been omitted here.

```
{
	orderId: "1234"
	orderUpdateId:0,
	nodes: [
	 	 f {released: True},
	 	 d {released: True},
	 	 g {released: True},
	 	 b {released: False},
	 	 h {released: False}
	],
	edges: [
		e1 {released: True},
		e3 {released: True},
		e8 {released: False},
		e9 {released: False}
	]
}
```
>Figure 5 Pseudo code of an order

At time t = 3, the order is updated by sending an extension of the order (see example in Figure 6). 
Note that the "orderUpdateId" is incremented and that the first node of the job update corresponds to the last shared base node of the previous order message.

This ensures that the AGV can also perform the job update, i.e., that the first node of the job update is reachable by executing the edges already known to the AGV.

```
}
	orderId: 1234,
	orderUpdateId: 1,
	nodes: [
		g {released: True},
		b {released: True},
		h {released: True},
		i {released: False}
	],
	edges: [
		e8 {released: True},
		e9 {released: True},
		e10 {released: False}
	]
}
```
>Figure 6 Pseudo code of an order update. Please look out for the change of the "orderUpdateId"

This also aids in the event that an orderUpdate goes missing (because of unreliable wireless network). 
The AGV can always check that the last known base node has the same nodeId (and nodeSequenceId, more on that later) as the first new base node.

Also note that node g is the only base node that is sent again.
Since the base cannot be changed, a retransmission of nodes f and d is not valid.

It is important, that the contents of the stitching node (node g in the example case) are not changed. 
For actions, deviation range, etc. the AGV must use the instructions provided in the first order (Figure 5, orderUpdateId 0).

![Figure 7 Regular update process - order extension](./assets/Figure7.png)
>Figure 7 Regular update process - order extension

Figure 7 describes how an order should be extended.
It shows the information, that is currently available on the AGV. 
The orderId stays the same and the orderUpdateId is incremented. 

The last node of the previous base is the first base node in the updated order.
With this node the AGV can add the updated order onto the current order (stitching). 
The other nodes and edges from the previous base are not resent.

Master control has the option to make changes to the horizon by sending entirely different nodes as the new base.
The horizon can also be deleted.

To allow loops in orders (like going from node a to b and then back to a) a sequenceId is assigned to the node and edge objects. 
This sequenceId runs over the nodes and edges (first node of an order receives a 0, the first edge then gets the 1, the second node then gets the 2, and so on). 
This allows for easier tracking of the order progress.

Once a sequenceId is assigned, it does not change with order updates (see Figure 7). 
This is necessary to determine on AGV side to which node the master control refers to. 

Figure 8 describes the process of accepting an order or orderUpdate.

![Figure 8 The process of accepting an order or orderUpdate](./assets/Figure8.png)
>Figure 8 The process of accepting an order or orderUpdate

1)	**is received order valid?**:
All formatting and JSON data types are correct?

2)	**is received order new or an update of the current order?**:
Is `orderId` of the received order different to  `orderId` of order the vehicle currently holds?

3)	**is vehicle still executing an order or waiting for an update?**:
Is `nodeStates` not empty or is `actionStates` containing states which are neither FAILED or FINISHED? Nodes and edges and the corresponding action states of the order horizon are also included inside the state. Vehicle might still have a horizon and therefore waiting for an update and executing an order.

4) **is start of new order close enough to current position?**:	Is the vehicle already standing on the node, or is in the nodes deviation range (see also chapter 6.6.1)?

5) **is received order update deprecated?**: Is `orderUpdateId` smaller than the one currently on the vehicle?

6)	**is received order update currently on vehicle?**: Is `orderUpdateId` equal to the one currently on the vehicle?

7)	**is the received update a valid continuation of the currently still running order?**:	Is the first node of the received order equal to the current decision point (last node of the current base)? The vehicle is still moving or executing actions related to the base released in previous order updates or still has a horizon and is therefore waiting for a continuation of the order. In this case, the order update is only accepted if the first node of the new base is equal to the last node of the previous base.

8)	**is the received update a valid continuation of the previously completed order?**: Is `nodeId` and `sequenceId` of the first node of the received order update equal to `lastNodeId` and `lastNodeSequenceId`? The vehicle is not executing any actions anymore neither is it waiting for a continuation of the order (meaning that it has completed its base with all related actions and does not have a horizon). The order update is now accepted if it continues from the last traversed node, therefore the first node of the new base needs to match the vehicle's `lastNodeId` as well as `lastNodeSequenceId`.

9)	populate/ append states	refers to the action-/node-/edgeStates.

### 6.6.3 Order Cancellation (by Master Control)

In the event of an unplanned change in the base nodes, the order must be canceled by using the instantAction cancelOrder.

After receiving the instantAction cancelOrder, the vehicle stops (based on its capabilities, e.g., right where it is or on the next node).

If there are actions scheduled, these actions must be cancelled and should report “failed” in their actionState. 
If there are running actions, those actions should be cancelled and also be reported as failed.
If the action cannot be interrupted, the actionState of that action should reflect that by reporting “running” while it is running, and after that the respective state (“finished”, if  successful and “failed”, if not).
While actions are running, the cancelOrder action must report “running”, until all actions are cancelled/finished. 
After all vehicle movements and all actions are stopped, the cancelOrder action status must report “finished”.

The orderId and orderUpdateId is kept. 

Figure 9 shows the expected behavior for different AGV capabilities.

![Figure 9 Expected behavior after a cancelOrder](./assets/Figure9.png)
>Figure 9 Expected behavior after a cancelOrder



#### 6.6.3.1 Receiving a new order after cancellation

After the cancellation of an order, the vehicle must be in a state to receive a new order. 

In the case of an AGV that localizes itself on nodes via a tag, the new order has to begin on the node the AGV is now standing on (see also Figure 5).

In case of an AGV that can stop in-between nodes, the choice is up to master control how the next order should be started. 
The AGV must accept both methods.

There are two options:

- Send an order, where the first node is a temporary node that is positioned where the AGV currently stands. The AGV must then realize that this node is trivially reachable and accept the order.
- Send an order, where the first node is the last traversed node of the previous order but set the deviation range so large that the AGV is within this range. Thus, the AGV must realize that this node must be counted as traversed and accept the order.



#### 6.6.3.2 Receiving a cancelOrder action when AGV has no order

If the AGV receives a cancelOrder action but the AGV currently has no order, or the previous order was cancelled, the cancelOrder action must report as failed.

The AGV must report a “noOrderToCancel” error with the errorLevel set to warning. 
The actionId of the instantAction must be passed as an errorReference.



### 6.6.4 Order rejection

There are several scenarios, when an order must be rejected. 
These are explained in Figure 8.



#### 6.6.4.1 Vehicle gets a malformed new order

Resolution:

1. Vehicle does NOT take over the new order in its internal buffer. 
2. The vehicle reports the warning "validationError"
3. The warning must be reported until the vehicle has accepted a new order.



#### 6.6.4.2 Vehicle receives an order with actions it cannot perform (e.g. lifting height higher than maximum lifting height, or lifting actions although no stroke is installed), or with fields that it cannot use (e.g. Trajectory)

Resolution: 

1. Vehicle does NOT take over the new order in its internal buffer 
2. Vehicle reports the warning "orderError" with the wrong fields as error references
3. The warning must be reported until the vehicle has accepted a new order. 



#### 6.6.4.3 Vehicle gets a new order with the same orderId, but a lower orderUpdateId than the current orderUpdateId

Resolution: 

1. Vehicle does NOT take over the new order in its internal buffer. 
2. Vehicle keeps the PREVIOUS order in its buffer. 
3. The vehicle reports the warning "orderUpdateError"
4. The vehicle continues with the executing the previous order. 

If the AGV receives an order with the same orderId and orderUpdateId twice, the second order will be ignored. 
This might happen, if the master control sends the order again, because the status message came too late and the master control could not verify that the first order was received.



### 6.6.5 Maps

To ensure consistent navigation among different types of AGV, the position is always specified in reference to the local map coordinate system (see Figure 10).
For the differentiation between different levels a unique mapId is used.
The map coordinate system is to be specified as a right-handed coordinate system with the z-axis pointing skywards. 
A positive rotation therefore is to be understood as a counterclockwise rotation. 
The vehicle coordinate system is also specified as a right-handed coordinate system with the x-axis pointing in the forward direction of the vehicle and the z-axis pointing skywards. 
This is in accordance with chapter 2.11 in DIN ISO 8855.

![Figure 10 Coordinate system with sample AGV and orientation](./assets/Figure10.png)
>Figure 10 Coordinate system with sample AGV and orientation

The X, Y and Z coordinates must be in meters. 
The orientation must be in radians and must be within +Pi and –Pi.

### <a name = "Corridor"></a> 6.7.1 Corridor attribute

The optional corridor edge attribute enables the vehicle to deviate from the edge trajectory for obstacle avoidance and defines the boundaries in which the vehicle is allowed to operate.
In this context the trajectory means the pre-planned path the vehicle would be driving if no corridor attribute is defined.
The behavior of a vehicle which uses the corridor attribute of an edge shall be still the behavior of a line guide vehicle with the ability to avoid obstacles.

(*Remark:
 An edge inside an order defines a logical connection between two nodes and not necessarily the (real) trajectory a vehicle follows driving from the start node to the end node.
Depending on the vehicle type the trajectory a vehicle takes between the start and the end node is either defined by MC via the trajectory edge attribute or deposed as predefined trajectories on the vehicle.
Depending on the internal vehicle state the selected trajectory may varying.*)

![Figure 16 Edges with boundaris.](./assets/Boundaries-1.png)
>Figure 16 Edges with boundaries (```corriorRefPoint``` is equal "KC").

The area in which the vehicle is allowed to navigate independently (and to deviate from the original edge trajectory) is defined by a left and right boundary. 
The optional field `corridorRefPoint` specifies whether the vehicle control point or the contour of the vehicle shall be within the defined boundaries.
The boundaries of the edges shall be defined in a way that once the vehicle has traversed a node the vehicle is inside the boundaries of the new and now current edge. 

The motion control software of the vehicle shall check permanently if the vehicle is inside the defined boundaries.
If this is not the case the vehicle shall stop, because it is outside of the allowed navigation space, and to report an error.
The MC can decide whether user interaction is required or if the vehicle can continue by cancelling the current order and sending a new order to the vehicle with corridor information that allows the vehicle to move again.

(*Remark:
Allowing the vehicle to deviate from the trajectory increases the possible footprint of the vehicle during driving. This circumstance has to be considered during initial operation and if MC makes
traffic control decision based on the vehicles footprint MC shall consider the possible deviation from the trajectory too.*)

See also section [6.10.2 Traversal of nodes and entering/leaving edges, triggering of actions](#Tonaeletoa) for further information.

## 6.8 Actions

If the AGV supports actions other than driving, these actions are executed via the action field that is attached to either a node or an edge, or sent via the separate topic instantActions (see 6.9).

Actions that are to be executed on an edge must only run while the AGV is on the edge (see 6.10.2).

Actions that are triggered on nodes can run as long as they need to run. 
Actions on nodes should be self-terminating (e.g., an audio signal that lasts for five seconds or a pick action, that is finished after picking up a load) or should be formulated pairwise (e.g., activateWarningLights and deactivateWarningLights), although there may be exceptions. 

The following section presents predefined actions that must be used by the AGV, if the AGVs capabilities map to the action description.
If there is a sensible way to use the defined parameters, they must be used. 
Additional parameters can be defined, if they are needed to execute an action successfully.

If there is no way to map some action to one of the actions of the following section, the AGV manufacturer can define additional actions that must be used by master control.

## 6.9 Topic: "instantActions" (from master to control to AGV)

In certain cases, it is necessary to send actions to the AGV, that need to be performed immediately. 
This is made possible by publishing an instantAction message to the topic instantActions.
instantActions must not conflict with the content of the AGV’s current order (e.g., instantAction to lower fork, while order says to raise fork).

Some examples for which instant actions could be relevant are: 
- pause the AGV without changing anything in the current order;
- resume order after pause ;
- activate signal (optical, audio, etc.).

For additional information, see chapter 8 Best practices.

When an AGV receives an instantAction, an appropriate actionStatus is added to the actionStates array of the AGV state.
The actionStatus is updated according to the progress of the action.
See also Figure 12 for the different transitions of an actionStatus.



## 6.10 Topic: "state" (from AGV to master control)

The AGV-State will be transmitted on only one topic.
Compared to separate messages (e.g., for orders, battery-state and errors) using one topic will reduce the workload of the broker and the master control for handling messages, while also keeping the information about the AGV state synchronized.

AGV-State message will be published with occurrence of relevant events or at the latest every 30s via MQTT-broker to master control. 

Events that trigger the transmission of the state message are:
- Receiving an order 
- Receiving an order update 
- Changes in the load status 
- Errors or warnings 
- Driving over a node 
- Switching the operating mode 
- Change in the "driving" field 
- Change in the nodeStates, edgeStates or actionStates 

There should be an effort to curb the amount of communication.
If two events correlate with each other (e.g., the receiving of a new order usually forces an update of the node- and edgeStates; as does the driving over a node), it is sensible to trigger one state update instead of multiple.



### 6.10.1 Concept and Logic 

The order progress is tracked by the `nodeStates` and `edgeStates`. 
Additionally, if the AGV is able to derive its current position, it can publish its position via the “position” field.

If the AGV plans the path by itself, it must communicate its calculated trajectory (including base and horizon) in the form of a NURBS via the `trajectory` object in the state message, unless master control cannot use this field and it was agreed during integration, that this field must not be sent.
After nodes are released by master control, the AGV is not allowed to change its trajectory.

The `nodeStates` and `edgeStates` includes all nodes/edges, that the AGV still must traverse.

![Figure 12 Order Information provided by the state topic. Only the ID of the last node and the remaining nodes and edges are transmitted](./assets/Figure12.png) 
>Figure 12 Order Information provided by the state topic. Only the ID of the last node and the remaining nodes and edges are transmitted



### 6.10.2 Traversal of nodes and entering/leaving edges, triggering of actions 

The AGV decides on its own, when a node should count as traversed.
Generally, the AGV’s control point should be within the node’s `deviationRangeXY` and its orientation within `deviationRangeTheta`.
If the edge attribute `corridor` of the subsequent edge is set, these boundaries should be meet additionally.

The AGV reports the traversal of a node by removing its `nodeState` from the `nodeStates` array and setting the `lastNodeId`, `lastNodeSequenceNumber` to the traversed node’s values.

As soon as the AGV reports the node as traversed, the AGV must trigger the actions associated with the node, if any.

The traversal of a node also marks the leaving of the edge leading up to the node. 
The edge must then be removed from the `edgeStates` and the actions that were active on the edge must be finished.

The traversal of the node also marks the moment, when the AGV enters the following edge, if there is one.
The edges actions must now be triggered. 
An exception to this rule is, if the AGV has to pause on the edge (because of a soft or hard blocking edge, or otherwise) – then the AGV enters the edge after it begins moving again.

![Figure 13 nodeStates, edgeStates, actionStates during order handling](./assets/Figure13.png)
>Figure 13 nodeStates, edgeStates, actionStates during order handling


### 6.10.3 Base request 

If the AGV detects, that its base is running low, it can set the `newBaseRequest` flag to `true` to prevent unnecessary braking.



### 6.10.4 Information 

The AGV can submit arbitrary additional information to master control via the `information` array.
It is up to the AGV how long it reports information via an information message.

Master control must not use the info messages for logic, it must only be used for visualization and debugging purposes.



### 6.10.5 Errors 

The AGV reports errors via the `errors` array. 
Errors have two levels: `WARNING` and `FATAL`.
A `WARNING` is a self-resolving error, e.g., a field violation. 
A `FATAL` error needs human intervention.
Errors can pass references that help with finding the cause of the error via the errorReferences array.

#### Operating Mode Description
The following description lists the operatingMode of the topic "states".

Identifier | Description 
---|---
AUTOMATIC | AGV is under full control of the master control. <br>AGV drives and executes actions based on orders from the master control.
SEMIAUTOMATIC | AGV is under control of the master control.<br> AGV drives and executes actions based on orders from the master control. <br>The driving speed is controlled by the HMI (speed can’t exceed the speed of automatic mode).<br>The steering is under automatic control (non-safe HMI possible).
MANUAL | Master control is not in control of the AGV. <br>Supervisor doesn’t send driving order or actions to the AGV. <br>HMI can be used to control the steering and velocity and handling device of the AGV. <br>Location of the AGV is sent to the master control. <br>When AGV enters or leaves this mode, it immediately clears all the orders (safe HMI required).
SERVICE | Master control is not in control of the AGV. <br>Master control doesn’t send driving order or actions to the AGV. <br>Authorized personnel can reconfigure the AGV. 
TEACHIN | Master control is not in control of the AGV. <br>Supervisor doesn’t send driving order or actions to the AGV. <br>The AGV is being taught, e.g., mapping is done by a master control.



## 6.11 actionStates

When an AGV receives an `action` (either attached to a `node` or `edge` or via an `instantAction`), it must represent this `action` with an `actionState` in its `actionStates` array.

`actionStates` describe in the field `actionStatus` at which stage of the actions lifecycle the action is.

Table 1 describes, which value the enum `actionStatus` can hold. 

actionStatus | Description 
---|---
WAITING | Action was received by AGV but the node where it triggers was not yet reached or the edge where it is active was not yet entered.
INITIALIZING | Action was triggered, preparatory measures are initiated.
RUNNING | The action is running.
PAUSED | The action is paused because of a pause instantAction or external trigger (pause button on AGV)
FINISHED | The action is finished. <br>A result is reported via the result.
FAILED | Action could not be finished for whatever reason.

>Table 1 The acceptable values for the actionStatus field

A state transition diagram is provided in Figure 14. 

![Figure 14 All possible status transitions for actionStates](./assets/Figure14.png)
>Figure 14 All possible status transitions for actionStates



## 6.12 Action Blocking Types and Sequence 

The order of multiple actions in a list define the sequence, in which those actions are to be executed. 
The parallel execution of actions is governed by their respective `blockingType`.

Actions can have three distinct blocking types, described in Table 2. 

blockingType | Description 
---|---
NONE | Action can be executed in parallel with other actions and while the vehicle is driving.
SOFT | Action can be executed in parallel with other actions. Vehicle must not drive.
HARD | Action must not be executed in parallel with other actions. Vehicle must not drive.

>Table 2 action blocking types

If there are multiple actions on the same node with different blocking types, Figure 15 describes how the AGV should handle these actions.

![Figure 15 Handling multiple actions](./assets/Figure15.png)
>Figure 15 Handling multiple actions



## 6.13 Topic "visualization" 

For a near real-time position update the AGV can broadcast its position and velocity on the subtopic `visualization`.

The structure of the position message is the same as the position and velocity message in the state.
For additional information see chapter 6.10 Implementation. 
The update rate for this topic is defined by the integrator.



## 6.14 Topic "connection"

During the connection of an AGV client to the broker, a last will topic and message can be set, which is published by the broker upon disconnection of the AGV client from the broker.
Thus, the master control can detect a disconnection event by subscribing the connection topics of all AGV.
The disconnection is detected via a heartbeat that is exchanged between the broker and the client. 
The interval is configurable in most brokers and should be set around 15 seconds.
The Quality of Service level for the `connection` topic shall be 1 - At Least Once.

The suggested last will topic structure is:

**uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection**

The last will message is defined as a JSON encapsulated message with the following fields:

Identifier | Data type | Description 
---|---|---
headerId | uint32 | Header ID of the message. <br>The headerId is defined per topic and incremented by 1 with each sent (but not necessarily received) message.
timestamp | string | Timestamp (ISO8601, UTC); YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.ffZ(e.g.“2017-04-15T11:40:03.12Z”).
version | string | Version of the protocol [Major].[Minor].[Patch] (e.g. 1.3.2).
manufacturer | string | Manufacturer of the AGV. 
serialNumber | string | Serial number of the AGV. 
connectionState | string | Enum {`ONLINE`, `OFFLINE`, `CONNECTIONBROKEN`}<br><br>`ONLINE`: connection between AGV and broker is active.<br><br>`OFFLINE`: connection between AGV and broker has gone offline in a coordinated way. <br><br> `CONNECTIONBROKEN`: The connection between AGV and broker has unexpectedly ended. 

The last will message will not be sent, when a connection is ended in a graceful way by using a MQTT disconnection command. 
The last will message is only sent by the broker, if the connection is unexpectedly interrupted.

**Note**: Due to the nature of the last will feature in MQTT, the last will message is defined during the connection phase between the AGV and the MQTT Broker.
As a result, the timestamp and headerId fields will always be outdated.

AGV wants to disconnect gracefully: 

1. AGV sends „uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection“ with `connectionState` set to `OFFLINE`.
2. Disconnect the mqtt connection with a disconnect command.

AGV comes online: 

1. Set the last will to „uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection“ with the field `connectionState` set to `CONNECTIONBROKEN`, when the mqtt connection is created.
2. Send the topic „uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection“ with `connectionState` set to `ONLINE`.

All messages on this topic shall be sent with a retained flag.

When connection between the AGV and the broker stops unexpectedly, the broker will send the last will topic: „uagv/v2/manufacturer/SN/connection“ with the field `connectionState` set to `CONNECTIONBROKEN`.

## 6.15 Topic "factsheet"

The factsheet provides basic information about a specific AGV type series.
This information allows comparison of different AGV types and can be applied for the planning, dimensioning and simulation of an AGV system.
The factsheet also includes information about AGV communication interfaces which are required for the integration of an AGV type series into a VDA-5050-compliant master control.

The values for some fields in the AGV factsheet can only be specified during system integration, for example the assignment of project-specific load and station types, together with the list of station and load types which are supported by this AGV.

The factsheet is both intended as a human-readable document and for machine processing, e.g., an import by the master control application, and thus is specified as a JSON document.

The MC can request the factsheet from the AGV by sending the instant action:  `factsheetRequest`

All messages on this topic shall be sent with a retained flag.

# 7 Best practice

This section includes additional information, which helps in facilitating a common understanding concurrent with the logic of the protocol. 



## 7.1 Error reference 

If an error occurs due to an erroneous order, the AGV should return a meaningful error reference in the fields errorReference (see [6.10.6 Implementation](#errorReferenceImpl)).
This can include the following information:

- headerId
- Topic (order or instantAction)
- orderId and orderUpdateId if error was caused by an order update 
- actionId if error was caused by an action
- List of parameters if error was caused by erroneous action parameters 

If an action cannot be completed because of external factors (e.g. no load at expected position), the actionId should be referenced.



## 7.2 Format of parameters 

Parameters for errors, information, actions are designed as an array of JSON-Objects with key-value-pairs. 
Sample for the actionParameter of an action “someAction” with key-value-pairs for stationType and loadType:

"actionParameters":[
{"key":"stationType", "value": "floor"},
{"key": "loadType", "value": "pallet_eu"}
]

The reason for using the proposed scheme of “key”: “actualKey”, “value”: “actualValue” is to keep the implementation generic. 
This was thoroughly and controversially discussed in multiple meetings.



# 8 Glossary 



## 8.1 Definition

Concept | Description 
---|---
Free navigation AGV | Vehicles that use a map to plan their own path. <br>The master control sends only start and destination coordinates.<br>The vehicle sends its path to the master control.<br>When the communication to the master control is broken off, the vehicle is able to continue its journey.<br>Free-navigation vehicles may be allowed to bypass local obstacles.<br>It may also be possible that a fine adjustment of the receiving/dispensing position by the vehicle itself is carried out.
Guided vehicles (physical or virtual) | Vehicles that get their path sent by the master control. <br>The calculation of the path takes place in the master control.<br>When communication to the master control is broken off, the vehicle terminates its released nodes and edges (the "base") and then stops.<br>Guided vehicles may be allowed to bypass local obstacles.<br>It may also be possible that a fine adjustment of the receiving/dispensing position by the vehicle itself is carried out.
Central map | The maps that will be held centrally in the master control.<br> This is initially created and then used.<br> A future version of the interface will make it possible to transfer this map to the vehicles (e.g., for free navigation).
